# Liquid Democracy FHE: An Autonomous Governance Framework

Liquid Democracy FHE is an innovative virtual world designed to implement a liquid democracy model with the power of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This project revolutionizes governance within online communities, allowing members to vote and delegate authority while ensuring privacy and integrity through advanced cryptographic methods.

## The Governance Challenge

In an age where digital interaction and decision-making increasingly shape our communities, traditional voting systems often fall short in terms of transparency, security, and privacy. The challenge lies in ensuring that participants can engage authentically without fear of manipulation or coercion. Current democratic models are rife with concerns over voter privacy and election integrity, leading to skepticism and disengagement among community members.

## The FHE Empowered Solution

Liquid Democracy FHE directly addresses the shortcomings of conventional governance systems by leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to protect sensitive voting data. Through Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we can perform calculations on encrypted data without exposing the underlying information. This means that voting, delegation, and tallying can occur securely, allowing us to explore next-generation democratic frameworks while safeguarding individual privacy.

With FHE, we can ensure that each vote is counted fairly and that the relationship between voters and delegates remains confidential, effectively eliminating threats of bribery and coercion. This transparency allows communities to foster trust and actively engage their members in governance.

## Key Features

- **Fully Encrypted Voting:** All votes and delegation relationships are encrypted using FHE, state-of-the-art security for digital governance.
- **Homomorphic Tallying:** Votes can be counted and weighted while still encrypted, ensuring complete confidentiality.
- **Advanced Governance Model:** A cutting-edge approach to democracy that enhances user participation and trust.
- **Visualization Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for visualizing the governance network and delegation structures, fostering transparency.
- **Community-Centric Design:** Tailored for large online communities to facilitate more privacy-aware decision-making.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** Primary component for enabling confidential computing.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** Development environments for Ethereum applications.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming language for Ethereum.
- **React.js:** Framework for building user interfaces that enhance user interaction with the governance platform.

## Installation Guide

To set up the Liquid Democracy FHE project, follow these instructions after downloading the project files:

1. Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed on your system. You can check your installation with:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. Initialize your environment by navigating to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Liquid_Democracy_Fhe
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries, by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Ensure you have installed **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for your development environment.

## Build & Run Guide

Once your installation is complete, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests to Ensure Everything Functions Properly:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Launch the Application:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

Replace `yourNetwork` with the appropriate network name where you are deploying your contracts.

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how votes are processed within the governance model:

```javascript
const { encryptVote } = require('./governance/voting');

function handleVote(delegator, candidate) {
    const encryptedVote = encryptVote(delegator, candidate);
    // Send to the blockchain for tallying
    sendToBlockchain(encryptedVote);
}

// Encrypting a vote using FHE
function encryptVote(delegator, candidate) {
    // Implementation for encrypting the vote securely
    return ZamaFHE.encrypt({ delegator, candidate });
}
```
